When would you want to use a remote reposistory rather than keeping all your work local?

I would like to use the remote repository when I am working with a team of people on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git allowa me to synch with the remote repository becasue in that case I would have a flexibity to only push changes wich are ready to be viewed by the public. This leaves control in my hands instead of Git automatically doing it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use on instead of another?

Clone - This pulls the copy of the entire repository to your local machine
Branch - This creates a new branch
Fork - This works like clone, execpt that the clone happens on github instead of on the local machine.
